Property getting and setting work within Node, but *getPrototypeOf* and *getOwnPropertyDescriptor* unit tests fail within Node.\n\n# Philosophy\n\nChrome used to have a proxy and it was abruptly removed over a year ago for unspecified security reasons. Proxies are useful. This is a development placeholder based on Object.observe until they become available again in early 2016. There is currently no plan to turn this into a robust long term implementation, particularly since Object.observe may disappear in 2016.\n\n# Release History (reverse chronological order)\n\nv0.0.9 2016-01-21  Reworked module closure wrapper so it would work regardless of wether *browserify* is used. \n\nv0.0.8 2016-01-18 Reworked module structure which seemed to fail to define Proxy in some situations.\n\nv0.0.7 2016-01-18 Corrected issue where deleted properties were not properly restored if deleteProperty trap failed.\n\nv0.0.6 2016-01-17 Created browserified and minified version. Added some unit tests. Added .travis.yml and .codeclimate.yml. Updated badges.\n\nv0.0.5 2015-12-13 Corrected README\n\nv0.0.4 2015-12-12 Codacy improvements, corrected error with setting __proxy__\n\nv0.0.1 2015-11-07 Initial public release. No unit tests yet. Consider this an ALPHA.\n\n# License\n\nMIT License - see LICENSE file\n",
