# Installation

npm install nested-object-model

Note: This package requires Object.observe. However, Object.observe is currently only available with Chrome and will probably be deprecated in 2016. Object.observe can be defined in terms of a Proxy for Firefox and other browsers that support Proxies, but Proxy is not available with Chrome (it is coming in 2016). Rather than introduce dependencies to this package, it is simply recommended that you npm install proxy-observe for non-Chrome environments.
