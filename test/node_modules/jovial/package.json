Here is an example Validator:\n\n```new Validator({name: {type: 'string', length: 25, required: true}, \n                  age: {type: 'number', min:0, max: 110},\n                  gender: {in: ['male','female']},\n                  ssn: {type: 'SSN'},\n                  location: {type: 'latlon'}})```\n                \nAlso supported are RegExp matching, soundex testing, range testing, developer supplied functions.\n\n[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/anywhichway/jovial.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/anywhichway/jovial)\n[![Codacy Badge](https://api.codacy.com/project/badge/grade/42cd44eee8794c22aa7a4f780abd2d0b)](https://www.codacy.com/app/syblackwell/jovial)\n[![Code Climate](https://codeclimate.com/github/anywhichway/jovial/badges/gpa.svg)](https://codeclimate.com/github/anywhichway/jovial)\n[![Test Coverage](https://codeclimate.com/github/anywhichway/jovial/badges/coverage.svg)](https://codeclimate.com/github/anywhichway/jovial/coverage)\n[![Issue Count](https://codeclimate.com/github/anywhichway/jovial/badges/issue_count.svg)](https://codeclimate.com/github/anywhichway/jovial)\n\n[![NPM](https://nodei.co/npm/jovial.png?downloads=true&downloadRank=true&stars=true)](https://nodei.co/npm/<jovial>/)\n\n# Install\n\nnpm install jovial\n\nThe index.js and package.json files are compatible with https://github.com/anywhichway/node-require so that joex can be served directly to the browser from the node-modules/joex directory when using node Express.\n\nBrowser code can also be found in the browser directory at https://github.com/anywhichway/jovial.\n\n\n# Usage\n\nThe core of JOVIAL is the Validator class. The constructor for Validator takes a configuration object consisting of properties with the same names as those to be validated on a target object. These properties contain configuration data restricting types, lengths, etc. or provide for value transformation prior to validation and final setting on a property.\n\nThe below will constrain 'name' to be a string and 'age' to be a number with a minimum value of 0 once the validator is bound to something:\n\n```var validator = new Validator({name: {type: 'string'}, age: {type: 'number', min:0}})``` \n\n*\\<validator\\>.bind(constructorOrInstance,onError[,name])*\n\nValidators are bound to either constructors or object instances using the *.bind* instance method. If an *onError* callback is not provided, then attempts to set invalid property values on the bound object will throw errors. The *onError* callback takes one argument, the error that would otherwise have been thrown. \n\nThe *name* argument is optional except in IE when binding a constructor because IE does not make available the *.name* property for Function objects. The names of bound constructors are used internal to the JOVIAL library for look-ups and must be available. \n\nThe *.bind* method returns either a new instrumented constructor or a proxy for the bound object. The new instrumented constructor should be used in place of the original constructor.\n\n## Validation Methods\n\nNote, with the exception of *.required*, validation checks are ignored if a value is *unknown*; otherwise, all checks would behave as if a value were required. However, if a value is *null*, validation checks are conducted, i.e. *null* is treated as a value whereas *unknown* is treated as the absence of a value that could theoretically pass any validation test.\n\n*\\<bound object\\>.validate(trap)*\n\nOnce bound, an object or instance returned from a bound constructor will have a *.validate* method. Invoking *.validate()* will attempt to validate all properties. \n\nIf *trap* is true, then a consolidated *Validator.ValidationError* or *undefined* will be returned. If *trap* is false, then either the *onError* provided during binding will be called with the consolidated error, or, if *onError* is undefined, the consolidated error will be thrown.\n\nFor example, the following will throw errors:\n\n```\nfunction Person() { p1.name = null, p1.age = null }\n\nvar validator = new Validator({name: {type: 'string'}, age: {type: 'number'}});\n\nvar p1 = new Person();\np1.name = 2; // intentionally incorrect type for example\np1.age = \"20\"; \np1 = validator.bind(p1); // binds validator to object so it will have validation\np1.validate(); // performs batch validation, an error will be thrown here\n\nPerson = validator.bind(Person); // binds validator to constructor so all instances have validation\nvar instance = new Person();\ninstance.name = 1; // real-time per property validation will be invoked, so an type error will be thrown here\n\n```\n\nSince JOVIAL supports both real-time per property validation and batch validation,the *Validator.ValidationError* thrown by JOVIAL is actually a container for other errors and details regarding the causes, e.g.:\n\n```{object: {name:null, age:null},errors:{name: {value: 2, validation: {type: {constraint: \"string\", error: [TypeError]}},{age: {value: -1, min: {constraint: 0, error: [RangeError]}}}}}```\n\nThe *.object* key points to the target object.\n\nThe *.errors* key points to an object for which there will be one key for every property that failed validation. The form is a follows:\n\n```{<property>:\n     {value: <invalid value>,\n     {validation: {<failed constraint name 1>: {constraint: <constraint value 1>, error: <Error 1>},\n     \t{<failed constraint name 2>: {constraint: <constraint value 2>, error: <Error 2>},\n        ...\n     }\n    }````\n\n*.echoes* = string \n\nTests to see is the target value has the same soundex as a constraint\n\n*.min*, *.max*, and *.between* = number | string | Array\n\nEnsures the value is greater than the provided min or max or between the values in what is assumed to be a 2 value array. The array constraint is ascending sorted prior to testing the target value and its first and last members are used as the min and max respectively.\n\n*.matches* = RegExp\n\nEnsures a value matches the provided regular expression.\n\n*.required* = true | false\n\nThrows an error is a property is missing or there is an attempt to delete it. Note, the deletion attempt must be done in a context that allows the error to bubble, so it may fail to work in some asych code situations. For example chrome-proxy uses Object.observe to manage property deletion. Objects proxied through chrome-proxy will not get proper validation for this constraint.\n\n*.in* = Array \n\nVerifies the target value is a member of the provide array\n\n*.length* = number |  Array\n\nSupports length checking on values with a length or count property, typically strings, Arrays and Sets. If *.length itself is an array, then its min and a max are used for testing the min and max length of the target value.\n\n*.satisfies* = function(any)\n\nThe developer supplied function should take a single argument and return *true* if the argument is a valid value and *false* if not.\n\n*.type* = \"string\" | \"boolean\" | \"function\" | \"object\" | \"SSN\" | \"tel\" | \"latlon\" | function\n\nIf a function is provided as a type, then the function is assumed to be a constructor and an *instanceof* check is done. If a target value is *unknown* then the type is assumed to match, otherwise type checking would behave like *.required*.\n\n####SSN \n\nMatches ###-##-##. Note, a value that looks like an SSN but is not actually a legal government issued number will pass.\n\n####tel \n\nMatches paretheses, dash, and dot separated US telephone numbers. Note, a value that looks like an telephone number but is not actually an active telephone company number will pass.\n\n####latlon\n\t\nLatitude and Longitude in Degrees Minutes Seconds (DMS) zero padded, separated by spaces or : or (d, m, s) or (�, ', \") or run together and followed by cardinal direction initial (N,S,E,W) Longitude Degree range: -180 to 180 Latitude Degree range: -90 to 90 Minute range: 0 to 60 Second range: 0.00 to 60.00 Note: Only seconds can have decimals places. A decimal point with no trailing digits is invalid.\n\nMatches\t\n\n40:26:46N,079:56:55W | 40�26'47\"N 079�58'36\"W | 40d 26m 47s N 079d 58' 36\" W | 90 00 00.0, 180 00 00.0 | 89 59 50.4141 S 090 29 20.4 E | 00 00 00.0, 000 00 00.0\n\nNon-Matches\t\n\n90 00 00.001 N 180 00 00.001 E | 9 00 00.00 N 79 00 00.00 E | 9 00 00.00, -79 00 00.00 | 90 61 50.4121 S 090 29 20.4 E | -90 48 50.

E | 00 00 00., 000 00 00.\n\nIf you would like additional validation methods, then post an issue to GitHub with the code based on the instructions in **Extending JOVIAL** below.\n\n## Augmentation Methods\n\n*.transform* = function(any)\n\nThe developer supplied function takes the target value to transform and returns a replacement prior to setting it on the underlying object. The below will ensure all names are strings:\n\n```{name: {transform: function(v) { return v+\"\";}}```\n\nThe transformation occurs before any validation.\n\n# Extending JOVIAL\n\nExtending JOVIAL is as simple as adding methods to the Validator class by the same name as the constraint desired and providing an optional error type. For example, the constraints 'between' and 'min' and 'max' are implemented as:\n\n```\nValidator.validation.between = function(between,value) {\n\t\tbetween.sort(function(a,b) { return a - b; });\n\t\tvar min = between[0];\n\t\tvar max = between[between.length-1];\n\t\treturn value>=min && value<=max;\n}\nValidator.validation.between.onError = RangeError;\n\nValidator.validation.min = function(min,value) {\n\t\treturn value>=min;\n}\nValidator.validation.min.onError = RangeError;\n\nValidator.validation.max = function(max,value) {\n\t\treturn value<=max;\n}\nValidator.validation.max.onError = RangeError;\n```\n\nUsing the above, we can extend the Person example as follows:\n\n```\nfunction Person() { }\nvar validator = new Validator({name: {type: 'string'}, age:{type: 'number', min: 0, max: 110}}});\nPerson = validator.bind(Person);\nvar instance = new Person();\ninstance.age = 120; // throws a RangeError {object: {},errors:{age: {value: 120, max: {constraint: 110, error: [RangeError]}}}}\n```\n\nor\n\n```\nfunction Person() { }\nvar validator = new Validator({name: {type: 'string'}, age:{type: 'number', between: [0,110]}});\nPerson = validator.bind(Person);\nvar instance = new Person();\ninstance.age = 120; // throws a RangeError {object: {},errors:{age: {value: 120, between: {constraint: [0,110], error: [RangeError]}}}}\n```\n\n# Implementation\n\nJOVIAL is implemented using a Proxy. As attempts are made to modify the properties of target objects at runtime, the validation routines are called with the constraint established by the Validator and the new values being set by the application code. The validators are selected based on the names of constraint attributes. \n\nFor versions of Chrome not supporting a Proxy the browser code includes the shim https://github.com/anywhichway/chrome-proxy while the server code has a dependency and does a conditional require.\n\n# Building & Testing\n\nBuilding & testing is conducted using Travis, Mocha, Chai, and Istanbul.\n\n# Notes\n\nDue to an unavoidable shortcoming in chrome-proxy, the unit test for testing the prevention of deleting required properties fails. All tests should pass in Edge and Firefox.\n\n# Updates (reverse chronological order)\n\n2016-01-23 v0.0.19 Corrected length check on Set when value is actually unknown.
